      <h1>Volunteer &amp; Collaborate</h1>
      <p>
        Help build a survivor-led, trauma-informed support system for newcomers
        and marginalized workers in British Columbia.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        The 777 Foundation Society is a survivor-led, trauma-informed
        non-profit in British Columbia. We design and deliver peer-led programs,
        legal advocacy support, emotional resilience activities, and outreach
        initiatives for newcomers and marginalized workers facing unsafe or
        exclusionary conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are in an early pilot and capacity-building phase and are
        intentionally building a small, stable cohort of volunteers, professional
        allies, and connectors who want to help shape a safer, more dignified
        path through BC’s systems – without exploiting anyone’s story.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What we’re building</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Peer-led groups and survivor-informed support networks</li>
        <li>
          Legal advocacy orientation and system navigation (not representation)
        </li>
        <li>Emotional resilience practices to reduce isolation and burnout</li>
        <li>
          Story-based outreach that highlights patterns of harm while protecting
          identities
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Programs are being developed carefully and at small scale so we can
        document what works, refine our methods, and grow in a safe,
        sustainable way.
      </p>

      <h2>Volunteer &amp; collaboration pathways</h2>
      <p>
        At this stage, we’re prioritising a few focused ways to get involved.
        Most roles are 2–4 hours per month, remote-friendly, with a preference
        for BC-based volunteers and partners.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Funding, Grants &amp; Partnerships Steward</strong> – channel
          aligned funding, grants, and partnerships into the organisation so we
          can build stable programs and infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal, Policy &amp; Advocacy Allies</strong> – advise on
          content and navigation frameworks for key systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mental Health &amp; Social Service Allies</strong> – support
          trauma-informed and culturally responsive practice and referrals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community Organisers, Designers &amp; Storytellers</strong> –
          help with outreach, education materials, and pattern-level advocacy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-profit Operations &amp; Governance Support</strong> – help
          strengthen policies, evaluation, reporting, and board tools.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Featured role: Funding, Grants &amp; Partnerships Steward</h2>
      <p>
        This role exists to open and stabilise the resource flow into The 777
        Foundation Society. You help translate our survivor-led mandate into
        concrete funding, grant, and partnership opportunities – and build the
        bridges so that aligned institutions, community foundations, family
        offices, and donors can support our work in a clean, structured way.
      </p>
      <h3>What you’ll focus on</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identifying aligned funding pathways (grants, community foundations,
          public programs, and select philanthropic or family-office
          opportunities).
        </li>
        <li>
          Helping prioritise a small number of high-fit opportunities instead of
          chasing everything.
        </li>
        <li>
          Acting as a connector and translator between our survivor-led story
          and the language of funders and institutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coordinating with our core team so proposals are realistic and stay
          trauma-informed and dignity-first.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where appropriate, supporting early-stage partnership conversations
          with community organisations and allies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What this role is not</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Not a solo fundraiser expected to “bring in money” alone.</li>
        <li>Not responsible for legal or financial sign-off.</li>
        <li>Not a public spokesperson for lived-experience stories.</li>
        <li>Not an emergency or crisis-response role.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Who this might suit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Experience in grants, fundraising, partnerships, social finance or
          non-profit management.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strong alignment with survivor-led, trauma-informed, and
          dignity-focused work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Comfortable reading funding guidelines and quickly spotting fit /
          misfit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Able to offer realistic, steady time (for example 2–4 hours per month
          over at least 6 months).
        </li>
      </ul>
